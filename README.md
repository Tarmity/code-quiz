## Installation

There are no installation guide as it is a web page that you go too. 


## Usage 

To start the Code Quiz simply open the link (https://tarmity.github.io/code-quiz/) and push the "start quiz" button and it will
take you to the first question, be sure not to waste any time as the timer has already started and you only have 10 seconds to answer the question. Make sure you pick the correct answers because for every wrong answer you will be deducted 2 seconds and you have 5 multiable questions to get through.
